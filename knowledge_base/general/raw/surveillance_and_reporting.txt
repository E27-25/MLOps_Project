ZOONOTIC DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND REPORTING — FIELD GUIDE
Source: WHO One Health / Thai DLD-DDC Joint Protocol / FAO EMPRES

WHAT ARE ZOONOSES?
Diseases transmissible between animals and humans. Over 200 known zoonoses.
75% of emerging infectious diseases originate in animals.
Most significant zoonoses in SE Asia: Avian Influenza, Rabies, Nipah, Leptospirosis, FMD (economic), Brucellosis, Q Fever, Scrub Typhus.

WHEN TO REPORT — ANIMAL DISEASE ALERTS:
Report ANY of the following to DLD IMMEDIATELY:
□ Sudden death of ≥3 animals in same herd/flock within 24 hours
□ Unusual neurological signs: circling, tremors, paddling, blindness, head pressing
□ Unexpected abortion storm: ≥3 abortions in 1 week in same herd
□ Severe bleeding (hemorrhage) from multiple body openings
□ Blisters (vesicles) on mouth, tongue, or feet of livestock
□ Animal biting unprovoked, with foaming/salivating excessively
□ Wild animals found alive on ground unable to fly/walk normally
□ Unusually high number of dead wild birds in one area
□ Any illness simultaneously affecting both animals AND people on same farm

THAILAND REPORTING CONTACTS:
- DLD Emergency Hotline: 02-653-4444 (24/7)
- Animal Disease Surveillance Center (ADSC): 02-579-8521
- Department of Disease Control (human cases): 1422
- Emergency Operations Center MOH: 02-590-1994
- FAO ECTAD Thailand (technical support for major outbreaks): +66-2-697-4000

SAMPLE COLLECTION BASICS:
Blood samples: 5–10 ml red-top tube; label with species, date, location, signs
Swabs: sterile viral transport media (VTM) for respiratory/cloacal swabs
Fresh tissue: spleen, lung, brain in double-sealed leak-proof bags
All samples: refrigerated (4°C), NOT frozen unless >24 hours from lab
Always wear gloves and mask when collecting samples from suspected zoonotic cases

ONE HEALTH FRAMEWORK:
- Animal Health (DLD): detect, respond, control disease in animals
- Public Health (DDC/MOH): monitor human cases, investigate exposure
- Environmental Health: vector control, habitat management
- Agriculture/Food Safety: ensure safe food chain
Coordination via Thai One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization (OHZDP) framework

BRUCELLOSIS (common in livestock — brief guide):
- Caused by Brucella abortus (cattle), B. melitensis (goats/sheep), B. suis (pigs)
- Humans: "undulant fever" — recurring fever, sweats, joint/muscle pain, fatigue (months to years)
- Animals: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis in males; no fever, no external signs
- Transmission: raw milk, unpasteurized cheese, birth fluids, placenta of infected animals
- Prevention: pasteurize all milk; wear gloves during calving; vaccinate cattle (S19/RB51)

Q FEVER (Coxiella burnetii):
- Reservoir: cattle, sheep, goats; shed massive quantities in birth fluids, placenta, and milk
- Human infection: inhale contaminated aerosol (during lambing/calving season)
- Symptoms: flu-like illness; chronic form → endocarditis (life-threatening)
- Prevention: handle placenta and birth fluids with gloves and mask; vaccinate livestock

SCRUB TYPHUS (Orientia tsutsugamushi):
- Vector: chigger mite larvae on rodents and vegetation
- Human: eschar (black scab) at bite site, fever, rash
- Common in Thailand hill tribe areas, rubber plantations, grasslands
- Treatment: Doxycycline 100mg BD x 7 days (very effective if given early)
- Prevention: DEET repellent, permethrin-treated clothing, avoid sitting on ground in scrub

PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) GUIDE:
Level 1 (routine animal contact): gloves, boots, hand hygiene
Level 2 (sick animals, unknown cause): + surgical mask, eye protection
Level 3 (suspected HPAI, Nipah, hemorrhagic fever): + N95 respirator, impermeable gown, face shield
Level 4 (confirmed BSL-4 pathogen): Full PAPR + sealed suit — specialist team only
