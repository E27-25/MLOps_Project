RABIES — PREVENTION, CONTROL, AND MASS VACCINATION
Source: WHO/OIE/FAO Rabies Blueprint / Thai DLD Rabies Control Program

MASS DOG VACCINATION:
- Target: >70% dog population vaccinated annually to break transmission
- Vaccine: inactivated rabies vaccine (licensed for dogs/cats)
- Annual booster required for sustained immunity
- Thai government: annual free vaccination campaign (World Rabies Day, September 28)
- Record all vaccinations in dog registry

WILDLIFE RABIES (Less common in SE Asia):
- Oral Rabies Vaccination (ORV): bait drops used in Europe/Americas for fox, raccoon rabies
- Not widely implemented in Southeast Asia
- Monkeys in tourist areas have caused human cases (Lopburi, Thailand)

PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PrEP):
Recommended for: veterinarians, animal handlers, laboratory workers, wildlife rangers, travelers to endemic areas
- 3 doses of human rabies vaccine: days 0, 7, 21 (or 28)
- Booster: every 3 years for continued risk, or based on antibody titer check

NOTIFICATION AND REPORTING:
- All suspected animal rabies cases: report to DLD within 24 hours
- All human exposures: report to local public health authority
- Animal head (not whole body) submitted to reference laboratory for FAT testing
- Submission: refrigerated, NOT frozen (FAT quality depends on tissue preservation)

STRAY DOG MANAGEMENT:
- Trap-Neuter-Vaccinate-Return (TNVR): reduces population while building herd immunity
- Impound-and-cull programs: less effective long-term (rapid reinvasion)
- Community-based education key: responsible pet ownership, avoid feeding strays

ELIMINATION TARGET:
- WHO goal: Zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030
- Thailand: active elimination program underway
- Key strategy: dog vaccination + PEP access + surveillance + awareness

SPECIMEN COLLECTION FOR DIAGNOSIS:
- Brain (cerebellum, brainstem, hippocampus) of dead animal
- Transport: refrigerated in sealed container with dry ice if >24 hours
- FAT: same day result at reference lab
- RT-PCR: confirmatory, can use fresh or fixed tissue
- NEVER open skull in the field — biosafety risk
