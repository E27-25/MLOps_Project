RABIES — CLINICAL GUIDE AND POST-EXPOSURE PROTOCOL
Source: WHO Expert Consultation on Rabies TRS 1012 / CDC Rabies Prevention

ETIOLOGY:
Rabies virus (RABV), genus Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae.
100% fatal once clinical signs develop. No approved treatment post-symptom onset.
Transmission: saliva of infected animal via bite, scratch, or mucous membrane contact.

CLINICAL SIGNS IN DOGS (primary vector in Asia/Africa):
Prodromal phase (2–3 days): personality change, anxiety, fever, hiding
Furious (excitative) phase:
- Extreme aggression, unprovoked biting of people, animals, objects
- Inability to swallow (hydrophobia — fear of water due to throat spasms)
- Excessive salivation ("foaming at the mouth") — virus-loaded
- Roaming, disorientation, altered bark (hoarse)
- Photophobia, erratic behavior
Paralytic (dumb) phase:
- Progressive ascending paralysis
- Drooping jaw, tongue hanging out
- Cannot swallow, drool continuously
- Coma → death (within 10 days of first signs)

KEY RULE: Any dog showing sudden aggression + hypersalivation + ataxia = SUSPECT RABIES

CLINICAL SIGNS IN CATS: similar to dogs; furious form more common; severe aggression
CATTLE: dumb form predominant; bellowing, yawning, progressive paralysis of hindquarters
BATS: may be found on ground (unable to fly), aggressive, active during daytime

ANIMAL OBSERVATION RULE (Dogs/Cats/Ferrets only):
- Observe clinically normal biting animal for 10 days
- If alive and healthy on day 10: not rabid at time of bite
- If animal dies/shows signs: submit brain for fluorescent antibody test (FAT)

WOUND CATEGORIES AND PEP:
Category I: touching/feeding animal, licks on intact skin → No PEP needed
Category II: nibbling, minor scratches without bleeding → Wound wash + Vaccine
Category III: single/multiple transdermal bites, licks on broken skin, ANY bat exposure → Wound wash + Vaccine + RIG

POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PEP) STEPS:
1. IMMEDIATE wound washing: soap and water vigorously for 15 minutes
2. Apply iodine solution or 70% ethanol
3. DO NOT suture wound (increases viral entry)
4. Rabies vaccine: Essen schedule (4 doses: days 0, 3, 7, 14) IM deltoid
5. Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG): 20 IU/kg human RIG or 40 IU/kg equine RIG
   - Infiltrate as much as possible INTO and around the wound on Day 0
   - Remaining dose: IM at distant site from vaccine

THAI CONTEXT:
- Rabies endemic in Thailand, especially dog-mediated
- Vaccine available at government hospitals (free or subsidized)
- RIG shortage: report to provincial health office if unavailable
- Call 1422 (Department of Disease Control hotline) for guidance
