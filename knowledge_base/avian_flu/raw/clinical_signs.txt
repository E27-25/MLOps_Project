AVIAN INFLUENZA — CLINICAL SIGNS AND DIAGNOSIS
Source: WOAH Terrestrial Manual Chapter 3.3.4 / FAO Animal Health Manual

SPECIES AFFECTED:
Chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, quail, pheasants, ostriches. All domestic and wild birds susceptible.
Wild waterfowl (ducks, geese, shorebirds) are natural reservoir hosts and often carry virus asymptomatically.

HPAI (H5N1/H5N6/H5N8) CLINICAL SIGNS:
- Sudden death with no premonitory signs (peracute form)
- Severe depression, ruffled feathers, huddling
- Cessation of egg production; soft-shelled, misshapen eggs
- Cyanosis (blue-purple discoloration) of comb, wattles, and unfeathered skin
- Facial edema, swelling of head, neck, eyelids
- Blood-tinged nasal and oral discharge
- Watery green-yellow diarrhea
- Neurological signs: ataxia, head and neck twisting (torticollis), loss of coordination
- Respiratory distress: gasping, gurgling, rattling breath
- Hemorrhages on shanks and feet (petechiae on toes)
- Mortality: 90–100% within 48–72 hours of first signs

LPAI (H9N2, H7N9 low path) CLINICAL SIGNS:
- Mild to moderate respiratory signs: sneezing, nasal discharge
- Reduced egg production (10–40% drop)
- Lower mortality unless complicated by secondary bacterial infection
- Can progress to HPAI through mutation in the field

DIFFERENTIALS TO CONSIDER:
- Newcastle Disease (NDV): similar neurological and respiratory signs; differentiate by PCR
- Infectious Bronchitis (IBV): mainly respiratory and reproductive; lower mortality
- Fowl Cholera (Pasteurella multocida): sudden death, blue comb, oily diarrhea
- Marek's Disease: progressive paralysis, usually in young birds only
- Mycoplasma synoviae: joint swelling, respiratory signs, slower progression

LABORATORY CONFIRMATION:
- Swabs: cloacal + oropharyngeal; fresh tissues (trachea, spleen, brain)
- Tests: RT-PCR (gold standard), hemagglutination inhibition (HI), virus isolation
- Notify national veterinary authority immediately upon suspicion
- Samples to national reference laboratory on ice within 24 hours

FIELD CHECKLIST:
□ Multiple birds dead suddenly (>3 in one flock in one day)
□ Comb/wattles blue-purple
□ Swollen head or eyelids
□ Twisting neck or circling behavior
□ Blood discharge from nostrils
→ REPORT IMMEDIATELY to District Livestock Development Officer
