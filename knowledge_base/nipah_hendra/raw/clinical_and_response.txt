NIPAH AND HENDRA VIRUS — CLINICAL GUIDE AND OUTBREAK RESPONSE
Source: WHO Nipah Preparedness Plan / Australian DAFF Hendra Factsheet / CDC Special Pathogens

ETIOLOGY:
Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV): genus Henipavirus, family Paramyxoviridae.
Both are BSL-4 pathogens. NO approved vaccine or specific antiviral for humans (as of 2024).
Natural reservoir: fruit bats (Pteropus spp.) — flying foxes, Lyle's flying fox in SE Asia.

NIPAH — ANIMAL HOSTS AND SIGNS:
PIGS (1998 Malaysia outbreak — amplifying host):
- Acute febrile illness, high fever 39–40°C
- Severe respiratory distress: labored, noisy breathing (distinctive "3-mile cough" / barking cough)
- Neurological signs: trembling, muscle twitching, hindlimb weakness, rear leg splaying
- Head pressing, aimless wandering, paddling seizures
- Rapid herd spread: 100% morbidity possible
- Mortality: 40% in Adults, >90% in piglets
- Nasal/throat secretions infectious — avoid direct contact

HORSES (Hendra — Queensland, Australia):
- Acute fever, respiratory distress (fluid in lungs — frothy nasal discharge)
- Neurological deterioration: facial muscle twitching, ataxia, circling
- Rapid death — median 48h from onset of neurological signs
- CFR in horses ~75%
- ALL suspected Hendra in horses = immediately notify Australian Chief Veterinary Officer
- Only vaccinated Hendra horses should be approached by vets (Equivac HeV vaccine available)

NIPAH — HUMAN CLINICAL FEATURES:
Malaysian strain:
- Encephalitis after 4–14 day incubation
- Fever, headache, dizziness, disorientation
- Rapid progression to coma; 40% CFR
- Survivors: 15–20% permanent neurological sequelae
Bangladesh strain (ongoing annual outbreaks):
- Human-to-human transmission documented (respiratory droplets + direct contact)
- Higher CFR: 70–100% in outbreak settings
- Transmission in hospital settings without PPE

RISK FACTORS FOR EXPOSURE:
- Pig farming near Pteropus bat colonies or fruit orchards
- Bamboo wells or date palm sap collection contaminated by bat feces/urine
- Climbing trees at dusk (disturbing bats)
- Fruit fallen from bat-fed trees consumed without washing
- Deforestation pushing bats into agricultural zones

IMMEDIATE RESPONSE PROTOCOL:
1. DO NOT approach affected pigs without full PPE (N95 + goggles + gown + double gloves)
2. IMMEDIATELY notify national authorities — Nipah is NOTIFIABLE
3. Isolate affected pigs; restrict farm access to minimum essential personnel
4. NO field necropsy — all samples to BSL-4 accredited laboratory
5. Contact tracing: all humans who had unprotected contact with sick animals
6. Healthcare staff: strict airborne + contact + droplet precautions
7. Laboratory samples: serum, CSF, urine, throat swab in triple-packaging

PPE REQUIREMENTS (minimum for handling suspected Nipah animals):
- Powered Air-Purifying Respirator (PAPR) or N95 minimum
- Eye protection: goggles (not face shield alone)
- Impermeable gown or Tyvek coverall
- Double nitrile gloves, taped at wrists
- Rubber boots + overshoe

TREATMENT:
No specific antiviral approved. Supportive care: ventilator support, seizure management.
Ribavirin: limited antiviral activity in vitro; Bangladesh trials inconclusive.
Monoclonal antibody m102.4: compassionate use in Australia for HeV exposures.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS (encephalitis + respiratory in pigs):
- PRRS (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome): similar but no neurological "barking"
- Swine Influenza: respiratory predominant; no major neurological
- PCV2 (Circovirus): chronic wasting; slower progression
→ Nipah suspected if: respiratory + neurological + high mortality + human illness in farm workers
