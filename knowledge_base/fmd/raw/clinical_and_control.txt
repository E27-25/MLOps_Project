FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE (FMD) — CLINICAL GUIDE AND CONTROL
Source: WOAH Terrestrial Code Section 8.8 / FAO FMD Technical Manual

ETIOLOGY:
Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV), Aphthovirus genus, Picornaviridae family.
7 serotypes: O, A, C, SAT1, SAT2, SAT3, Asia1. No cross-immunity between serotypes.
Southeast Asia: predominantly serotype O, A, and Asia1 circulating.

SPECIES AFFECTED:
Primary: cattle, buffalo, pigs, sheep, goats, deer
Wildlife: elephants, rhinoceros, giraffe, hedgehogs
NOT affected: horses, dogs, cats (resistant)
Pigs = amplifying host (shed 1000x more airborne virus than cattle)

CLINICAL SIGNS:
Incubation: 2–14 days (average 3–5 days)

CATTLE AND BUFFALO:
- High fever (40–41°C) for 1–2 days before vesicles appear
- Drooling excessively, smacking lips, reluctance to eat
- Vesicles (fluid-filled blisters): tongue (gray-white, on dorsal surface), dental pad, lips, gums, palate
- Ruptured vesicles → raw, painful ulcers on mouth
- Foot lesions: coronary band (hair line junction), interdigital space, bulb of heel
- Severe lameness: cattle refuse to walk, may kneel when eating
- Teat lesions → mastitis, milk drop (50–80%)
- "Milk drop syndrome" in dairy cows: sudden unexplained production fall before oral signs

PIGS:
- Foot lesions more prominent than mouth lesions
- Severe lameness — pigs refuse to stand; squeal when moved
- Blisters on snout (common), teats

SHEEP AND GOATS:
- Often subclinical or mild
- Foot lesions predominant; mouth lesions mild
- Abortion possible in pregnant animals

MORTALITY:
- Adult animals: low (<5%) unless secondary bacterial infections
- Young calves/lambs/piglets: high (50–100%) from myocarditis ("tiger heart")
- Morbidity: 100% in naive unvaccinated population

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES:
- Vesicular Stomatitis (VSV): horses affected (helps differentiate)
- Swine Vesicular Disease (SVD): pigs only; cannot differentiate clinically from FMD in pigs
- Bluetongue: sheep; no foot lesions; insect vector
- Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD): ulcers but usually no vesicles
→ LABORATORY CONFIRMATION ESSENTIAL: RT-PCR, antigen ELISA

OUTBREAK RESPONSE:
1. IMMEDIATELY report to DLD — FMD is NOTIFIABLE (WOAH List A)
2. Stop all animal movement on/off premises
3. Do not allow other farm visits; change clothing and shoes before leaving
4. Separate sick animals in clean area; good nursing care (soft feed, clean water)
5. Implement quarantine zone (3 km) + surveillance zone (10 km)

FMD SPREAD MECHANISMS:
- Aerosol: virus travels up to 60 km downwind on land; 300 km over sea
- Contact: direct animal-to-animal; highest risk at markets
- Fomites: boots, vehicles, clothing worn by handlers
- Products: fresh/frozen untreated meat from infected animals; milk
- 2001 UK: spread via illegally imported infected meat fed to pigs (swill feeding)

ECONOMIC IMPACT:
- Immediate export ban on live animals and animal products from affected country
- 2001 UK outbreak: £8 billion loss
- Asia-1 reintroduction to Europe (Bulgaria 2011): devastated livestock trade

CONTROL ZONING (WOAH standards):
- Infected Zone (IZ): mandatory stamping out or emergency vaccination
- Protection Zone (PZ): 3 km radius — enhanced surveillance + movement control
- Surveillance Zone (SZ): 10 km — movement control
- FMD-free zone with vaccination vs without vaccination (different trade implications)
