LEPTOSPIROSIS — CLINICAL GUIDE, MANAGEMENT, AND PREVENTION
Source: WHO Leptospirosis Guidelines / CDC / Merck Veterinary Manual / Thai DDC

ETIOLOGY:
Pathogenic Leptospira serovars (>260 known). Family Leptospiraceae.
Primary reservoir: RATS (Rattus norvegicus, R. rattus) — chronic renal carrier, shed bacteria in urine lifelong.
Other reservoirs: cattle, pigs, dogs, horses, raccoons, opossums, hedgehogs.
Environment: survives in warm, moist soil and water for weeks to months.

TRANSMISSION (ANIMALS TO HUMANS):
Direct: contact with urine, blood, or tissues of infected animals
Indirect (most common): contact with water, soil, or mud contaminated with infected urine
Entry routes: cuts, abrasions, mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth), waterlogged skin

HIGH-RISK OCCUPATIONS:
- Rice farmers and field workers (flooded paddies)
- Sugarcane cutters (rat-infested fields)
- Livestock farmers (cattle, pig, dairy)
- Sewage and slaughterhouse workers
- Veterinarians and animal handlers
- Military personnel in jungle/field training
- Flood disaster response workers

ANIMAL CLINICAL SIGNS:
CATTLE:
- Abortion storm: sudden unexplained abortions (late gestation)
- Hemoglobinuria: red/brown discolored urine ("red water")
- Hemolytic anemia, jaundice (yellow mucous membranes)
- Acute mastitis: "flabby bag syndrome" — sudden milk drop, hemorrhagic milk
- Drop in milk production (50–75% in dairy herds)

DOGS:
- Acute renal failure: vomiting, lethargy, brown urine, not urinating
- Hepatitis: jaundice, vomiting, anorexia
- Leptospiral pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome (LPHS): coughing blood, severe respiratory distress
- Uveitis (eye inflammation): late complication, can lead to blindness
- Serovar Canicola: primarily renal disease; Icterohaemorrhagiae: severe jaundice

PIGS: abortion, stillbirths, weak piglets; less clinical than cattle
HORSES: abortion, recurrent uveitis ("moon blindness"), rarely severe systemic disease

HUMAN CLINICAL FEATURES:
Phase 1 — Leptospiremic (days 1–7):
- Sudden high fever (39–40°C), severe headache, myalgia (especially calf muscles)
- Conjunctival suffusion (red eyes without discharge — key sign)
- Rash, vomiting, abdominal pain

Phase 2 — Immune/Weil's phase (days 7–14):
Mild (80% of cases): spontaneous recovery
Severe/Weil's Disease (10–20%):
- Jaundice + renal failure + bleeding = classic Weil's triad
- Pulmonary hemorrhage (can be fatal within hours)
- Myocarditis, uveitis, meningitis

DIAGNOSIS:
- MAT (Microscopic Agglutination Test): gold standard serology; paired samples at 1 and 2 weeks
- PCR: blood in first week of illness; urine from day 7 onward
- Culture: takes 13 weeks; reference labs only
- ELISA: rapid screening; less specific

TREATMENT:
Mild cases: Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days
Severe/Weil's Disease: IV Penicillin G 1.5 million units every 6 hours, OR IV Ceftriaxone 1 g daily x 7 days
Supportive: dialysis for renal failure; blood products for hemorrhage

FLOOD OUTBREAK PROTOCOL (Thailand):
- Enhanced surveillance after major floods (July–October rainy season peak)
- Mass doxycycline prophylaxis: 200 mg once weekly for high-risk flood workers
- Vector control: rat trapping/bait before and after floods
- Watershed alerts issued by DDC (Department of Disease Control)
- Report clusters: ≥2 cases with common exposure site within 14 days

VETERINARY PREVENTION:
- Cattle/pig vaccination: annual bivalent or multivalent Leptospira bacterin
- Rodent control: critical for reservoir management; regular baiting
- Drain standing water, repair leaking pipes, seal rodent entry
- Separate animal drinking water from open ponds/streams
